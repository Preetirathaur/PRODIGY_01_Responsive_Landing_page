          <p class="subsectag text-small">In a quiet village, there lived a farmer named Arjun who worked tirelessly to grow crops and feed his family. One year, after months of labor, a fierce storm wiped out his entire harvest. Arjun was crushed. He had invested all his time, energy, and hopes into the crops, only to lose everything in a single night.
              Day after day, Arjun sat by his barren fields, consumed by regret and sorrow. He kept replaying the storm in his mind, wondering if he could have done something differently. His neighbors began preparing for the next planting season, but Arjun couldn't bring himself to start again. He was trapped in yesterday’s failure, unable to move forward.
              One morning, a wandering sage stopped by and saw Arjun sitting idly. "Why do you sit here mourning yesterday when tomorrow offers new possibilities?" the sage asked. Arjun sighed, "I can’t shake the loss. It’s too heavy."
              The sage smiled and said, "Yesterday is like a stone; if you carry it, it will weigh you down. But if you let it go, you can walk freely."
              Realizing the wisdom in these words, Arjun decided to move on. He tilled his fields again, planting fresh seeds, with hope for a better tomorrow.

      <p class="subsectag text-small">In a bustling city, there lived a man named Ravi who was always overwhelmed by his daily tasks. His mornings started in chaos—he’d wake up late, rush through breakfast, and leave home in a panic. By the time he reached work, the day seemed to be controlling him, rather than the other way around. Deadlines piled up, meetings stretched on endlessly, and his stress only grew. Every evening, he’d come home exhausted, wondering where the time had gone, yet nothing ever felt truly accomplished.
        One evening, Ravi met his old friend Aman, who had a calm, confident energy. Ravi asked, “How do you manage to stay so relaxed with everything going on?”
        Aman smiled and replied, “The secret is simple: Either you run the day, or the day runs you. I wake up early, plan my tasks, and prioritize. The key is to take control before things spiral.”
        Inspired, Ravi decided to make a change. The next morning, he woke up an hour earlier, spent some time organizing his day, and tackled the most important tasks first. Gradually, he noticed a difference. With structure and focus, his days became more manageable, and he felt more in control.
        From then on, Ravi realized that with a little discipline, he could steer his days instead of being dragged by them.

      <p class="sectag text-big">Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another stepping stone to greatness.</p>
      <p class="subsectag text-small">In a distant kingdom, there was a young queen named Elara. She had recently ascended the throne after the sudden death of her father, a ruler known for his wisdom and success. Elara felt immense pressure to live up to his legacy, and every decision she made felt like a weight on her shoulders. Fear of failure consumed her, and she hesitated to take bold actions, worried that one wrong move could tarnish her father’s reputation. One day, an old advisor named Thalia approached her. Seeing the queen’s hesitation, Thalia asked, “Your Majesty, why do you hesitate to lead boldly?”
        Elara sighed, “I’m afraid of making a mistake, of failing my people.”
        Thalia smiled and responded, “Think like a queen, Your Majesty. A true queen is not afraid to fail. Every failure is merely a stepping stone to something greater.”
        That night, Elara thought deeply about Thalia’s words. She realized that her fear of failure was holding her back, not her abilities. The next day, she made a risky decision to invest in rebuilding a struggling part of her kingdom, even though many opposed the idea. The project faced setbacks, but Elara didn’t waver.
        Over time, her bold choices led to a thriving economy, and her people praised her courage. Elara had learned that failure wasn’t the enemy—it was a path to greatness.
